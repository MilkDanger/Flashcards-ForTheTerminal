the face of your moon
when I'm blooming
that luminescence looming
UV rays zooming through me
Say I tote an umbrella
Give my coat to other fellas
But the taste of your throat is hella swell
If I fell and drop my paints
would they go to waste
or would you grab my hand
Stop, drop, roll
Til each of our pigments are replaced
and the past is just a figment of imagination
I may not be inventive
But here's an inventation
Learn my every indent 
Take my pain and impatience
Draining tides of layman's pride
When the land has dried I dry my eyes
look up to the skies 
The face of your moon
She always stays in place 
I chase a flicker of a comet's snicker
Why spend time harvesting dirt and ice?
only to see what's out there
only to fill a starving mind
A banquet in the banks of your craters
I'll save a few more bites for later
Savour their dusty flavour
Suck up just one more line
